# OwlheadDemo
This program is a demo of the Owlhead Program created in Unity by the OwlHead team of the Tufts University IDEA Human Factors Lab. It is a VR game that gives the user a FOV far beyond the lense FOV of a normal headset. (Our current record for practical FOV expansion is expanding 96 degrees of vision to 155 degrees.)

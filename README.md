# OwlheadDemo
This program is a demo of the Owlhead Program created in Unity by the OwlHead team of the Tufts University IDEA Human Factors Lab. It is a VR game that gives the user a FOV far beyond the lense FOV of a normal headset. (Our current record for practical FOV expansion is expanding 96 degrees of vision to 155 degrees.) 

While the code of this project can't be shared due to security reasons, the general process can be. The purpose of this project is to test the usefulness of and expanded field of vision by creating spotting games the user can play at different FOV's. For this simulation, we created a game in which birds will fly at you, and the player has to scare them off by looking right at them and hitting a button. As part of the test, this game will be played at different FOV's to see how much benefit the expanded vision provides the player.
